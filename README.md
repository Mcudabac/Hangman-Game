# Hangman-Game

PLEASE CHECK OUT THE hangman.txt FILE TO SEE WORK.

Created Fall Semester 2014 in CINS 110: Introduction Programming (Javascript) as one of my major projects. 
The game applied the use of arrays, canvas, for loops, if/else statements, and lots of time to complete. 

To play simply enter in one letter at a time and press the reload window button when attempting to play again.
